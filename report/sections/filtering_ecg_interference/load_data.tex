\subsection{Signal Visualization}
The dataset \texttt{adapecg.mat} was loaded, containing electromyography (EMG) signals recorded from the 
sternomastoid muscle during five respiratory cycles at two different inspiratory effort levels: low and high.

The raw signals are visualized in Figure \ref{fig:raw_emg}. Both signals exhibit significant cardiac 
interference, characterized by sharp, periodic QRS complexes. In the "High Effort" scenario, the 
amplitude of the EMG activity increases drastically during inspiratory bursts, partially masking 
the ECG artifacts.
