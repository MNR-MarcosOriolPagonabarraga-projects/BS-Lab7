\subsection{Adaptive Filtering of High-Effort EMG}

The adaptive filter, tuned on the low-effort signal ($\mu=0.1$, Order 600, Smart Initialization), was applied to 
the High-Effort EMG signal. Reference impulses were generated using the same \texttt{avg\_beat} template.

Despite the significantly higher amplitude of the respiratory muscle activity, the filter successfully isolated 
and removed the ECG interference (Figure \ref{fig:high_effort_res}), with better results with the $\mu=0.1$ parameter. 
The underlying EMG bursts are preserved, and the periodic cardiac spikes are attenuated significantly.
