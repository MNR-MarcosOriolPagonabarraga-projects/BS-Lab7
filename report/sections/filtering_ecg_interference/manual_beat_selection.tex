\subsection{Manual Beat Selection}
Using the previous signal visualization, we can manually select the ECG beats to create a template for filtering.
Looking at the non inspiratory parts of the EMG signal, 15 ECG artifacts were identified and their positions recorded.

The indexes of the selected beats are as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Indexes of manually selected ECG beats}, label={lst:manual_beat_indexes}]
manual_peak_locs = [1823, 2459, 3083, 3727, 5600, 
                    6227, 6865, 7498, 10643, 11284, 
                    11933, 12571, 13211, 15740, 17035];
\end{lstlisting}
