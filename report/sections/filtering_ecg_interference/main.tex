\section{filtering ECG Interference from EMG Signals}
In this section, we address the challenge of removing ECG interference from EMG signals recorded 
during different inspiratory efforts. The presence of ECG artifacts can significantly distort the 
EMG signal, making it difficult to analyze muscle activity accurately. We will employ adaptive 
filtering techniques to mitigate this interference, using a template derived from the low-effort 
EMG signal as a reference.
