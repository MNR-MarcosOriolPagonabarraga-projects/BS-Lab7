\subsection{Manual Beat Selection}
To derive a clean template of the ECG interference, it is crucial to select beats that are not contaminated by the 
high-amplitude EMG activity occurring during inspiration. Following the laboratory guidelines, the Low Effort EMG 
signal was filtered (Butterworth, 6th order, 70 Hz cutoff) to facilitate visualization.

We manually identified 15 QRS complexes during the "quiet" expiratory phases. The sample indices of these 
peaks were recorded to serve as synchronization points for template extraction.
